# Bike Rental Modeling And Analysis
This repository contains code and related materials used for the paper: "Understanding and Predicting Bicycle Sharing Rental Patterns: A Linear Modeling Approach". It provides an in-depth exploration and modeling of a bike rental dataset. The primary goal is to understand bike rental demand patterns and factors influencing them, along with implementing predictive models for future demands.

The codebook involves data preprocessing, where the dataset is cleaned, transformed, and readied for model fitting. Two statistical modeling techniques - Lasso Regression and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression - are applied, providing a comparative analysis of their performance. In addtion, we also implemented a rolling window cross validation method to select parameters for all these models. Performance evaluation is carried out using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Relative Mean Squared Error (RelMSE). The repository also features various visualization tools to aid understanding and interpretability, including fitted vs. true plots, residual plots, and time series plots.
